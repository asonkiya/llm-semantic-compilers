# Status

Snapshot of where CGIR is today. Source of truth for "what runs" is `pytest -q`; source of truth for "what's stubbed" is `grep -rn "milestone:\|STUB:" src/`.

## What works end-to-end

The Python ingest → ComponentSpec pipeline runs:

```
cgir scan tests/fixtures/python_sample --out /tmp/cgir-out
```

…produces a `repo_graph.json`, `components/*.json` (validated against the schema), `components_index.json`, and `trace_map.json`. On the in-tree fixture both `pricing.add_tax` and `orchestrator.quote` classify as `pure_function` with `purity: 1.0` and the cross-file `CALLS` edge resolves correctly.

## Test coverage

`pytest -q` runs 133 tests, all green:

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `tests/unit/test_ir_graph.py` | RepoGraph add/query, JSON serialization |
| `tests/unit/test_component_spec.py` | Schema round-trip + invalid-kind rejection |
| `tests/unit/test_tree_sitter_source.py` | File / function / parameter ingest counts; default ignore-dirs (venv, node_modules, build, dist, __pycache__, site-packages); custom ignore extends default; dot-prefix dirs; decorated functions (@property, @staticmethod, @classmethod, multi-decorator stack, decorated class) |
| `tests/unit/test_symbols.py` | Local function/class bindings; absolute `from a.b import c`; relative imports (`.x`, `..x`); relative imports drive `CALLS`; unresolved external imports stay opaque; `IMPORTS` edge target attribute |
| `tests/unit/test_call_graph.py` | Cross-file `CALLS` resolution |
| `tests/unit/test_effects.py` | Pure / io / raise / transitive / per-function coverage; net (requests, urllib), fs (os.remove, shutil, .write_text), nondeterm (random, time.time, datetime.now, uuid4); arbitrary method calls stay untagged |
| `tests/unit/test_purity.py` | 1.0 / 0.7 / 0.0 tiers, pure caller stays pure |
| `tests/unit/test_cfg.py` | CFG topology (chain, if/else, if/elif/else, for, while, return-as-sink, nested); Assignment `writes`/`mutates` for simple/tuple/subscript/attribute LHS; per-node `reads` (RHS, condition, iterable, returned value; excludes attribute names and callee names); `controlled_by` threading through nested branches and loops; `with` bodies + header alias writes/context reads; `try`/`except`/`else`/`finally` bodies, except-as-Branch, except alias writes; `match` case Branch chains, case-body control deps, subject reads; augmented assignment writes/mutates/reads; mutator-call `mutates` (`xs.append`, chained `self.config.update`, non-mutator negative); for-target writes (simple + tuple) |
| `tests/unit/test_reaching_defs.py` | Pure-graph signature, linear def→use, kill on reassignment, branch-merge union, parameter as initial def, loop back-edge propagation, var-isolation, empty-function shape, full-coverage shape; with-alias and for-target as defs |
| `tests/unit/test_pdg.py` | Pure-graph signature; `FLOWS_TO` for linear/reassignment/parameter/branch-merge; no flow for unread defs; var-filtered flow; `DEPENDS_ON` for if-body and loop-body; no control-dep for top-level stmts; for-target and with-alias `FLOWS_TO` body uses |
| `tests/unit/test_slicer.py` | `pure_function` regression + `purity == 1.0`; `self.x` mutation, `xs.append(x)`, and `self.total += n` classify as `state_transformer`; mutating a *local* list/dict stays `pure_function`; mutating a module-level global counts |
| `tests/unit/test_trace_map.py` | path:line lookup |
| `tests/integration/test_cli_scan.py` | Full CLI pipeline writes correct outputs |

The `test_symbols.py` row is intentional debt — symbol resolution is exercised transitively by the call-graph tests but doesn't have a direct red-green pair yet. Pick it up before any change to `analyses/symbols.py`.

## Recent milestones

| When | Milestone | How |
|---|---|---|
| Sprint 0 | Initial scaffold | Manual implementation per `goofy-zooming-clock.md` plan |
| Sprint 0 | P0-effects | Red-green TDD — `tests/unit/test_effects.py` first, then `analyses/effects.py` |
| Sprint 0 | P0-purity | Red-green TDD — `tests/unit/test_purity.py` first, then `analyses/purity.py` |
| Sprint 0 | Slicer `kind` classification | Test update in `test_slicer.py` first, then `_classify` rewrite |
| Sprint 1 | P1-cfg | Red-green TDD — `tests/unit/test_cfg.py` (11 tests) first, then `analyses/cfg.py`. Wired between `call_graph` and `effects` in the CLI pipeline. |
| Sprint 2 | P1-reaching-defs | Red-green TDD — extended `test_cfg.py` with `writes`-attr tests, added `test_reaching_defs.py` (9 tests). Implemented worklist may-analysis in `analyses/reaching_defs.py` as the first pure-graph (no `repo_path`) analysis. |
| Sprint 2 | Shared tree-sitter helper | Refactor step after Sprint 2 green: extracted duplicated `_parser` / `_locate_function` from `call_graph`, `effects`, `cfg` into `analyses/_python_ast.py`. First opportunistic step on the grammar-agnostic core refactor (see `roadmap.md` "Beyond"). |
| Sprint 3 | P1-pdg | Red-green TDD — extended CFG with `reads`/`mutates`/`controlled_by` attrs (16 new test_cfg.py tests); added `test_pdg.py` (10 tests) for `FLOWS_TO` (data dep) and `DEPENDS_ON` (control dep). Second pure-graph analysis. Wired reaching-defs + PDG into the CLI scan pipeline. |
| Sprint 3 | `state_transformer` classification | Slicer reads `Assignment.attrs["mutates"]` to detect functions that mutate via attribute or subscript LHS. `tests/unit/test_slicer.py` pins a method `set_x(self, v): self.x = v` as `state_transformer`. |
| Sprint 4 | Real-world usability fixes | Ingester now skips `DEFAULT_IGNORE_DIRS` ({venv, node_modules, build, dist, __pycache__, site-packages, .tox, .pytest_cache, .mypy_cache, .ruff_cache, target, out, env}) and accepts a `--exclude` flag for custom names. Decorated functions and classes (`@property`/`@staticmethod`/`@classmethod`/multi-decorator stacks) are now surfaced. Relative imports (`from .x import y`, `from ..a.b import c`) resolve to absolute targets and feed the `CALLS` resolver. CLI scan prints a per-kind histogram after writing the index. Smoke-tested on the CGIR codebase itself: `cgir scan .` produces 219 components with sane distribution and runs in ~1s. |
| Sprint 5 | Precision fixes (closes all four Sprint-4 gaps) | Red-green TDD — 43 new tests. `with`/`try`/`match` bodies now traversed: `with` headers define their `as` aliases and keep the outer controller; `except` clauses become `Branch` nodes (handler bodies control-dependent, `as exc` alias is a def); `match` cases mirror if/elif Branch chains. Augmented assignments feed writes/mutates/reads. Bare mutator calls (`xs.append(x)`, `self.config.update(d)`) record `mutates` via a known-mutator-method table. `for` targets are defs. `reaching_defs`/`pdg` generalized: any CFG node with non-empty `writes` is a definition. Effects taxonomy extended with lexical `net`/`fs`/`nondeterm` matching (`_classify_dotted_call`). Slicer now gates mutation on caller observability: mutating a locally-created object stays pure — self-scan `state_transformer` count dropped from 32 (mostly false) to 5 (all true). |

## Known precision gaps

Real codebases will hit these — flag rather than guess:

- **Effect matching is lexical.** `net`/`fs`/`nondeterm` match the dotted callee text against prefix/suffix tables. `import requests as r; r.get(url)` escapes; `self.now()` false-positives on the `.now` suffix. Symbol-resolved effect matching is future work.
- **Mutator-method detection is a fixed name table.** `_MUTATOR_METHODS` covers the common list/dict/set/deque/queue/file mutators. Unknown mutator names and calls whose result is consumed (`x = xs.pop()`) are missed.
- **`case` patterns don't bind.** `case Point(x=a):` binds `a`, but pattern captures aren't extracted as writes — only the subject read and guard reads are recorded.
- **`break` / `continue` jump targets** aren't modelled; loop `else` clauses and exception flow *within* a try body (a raise mid-block skipping the rest) are approximated.
- **Local-mutation gate is name-based.** A local name rebound to a parameter (`alias = xs; alias.append(x)`) is treated as local and stays pure — no alias analysis.
